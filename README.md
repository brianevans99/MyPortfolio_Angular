## Project Status

Welcome to my portfolio and personal information website. In each release, my goal is to make it as eye-catching, lightweight and fast-loading as possible. This release is built with Angular and includes a new contact form.

## Technologies

This project uses Angular and Material UI for front-end design and a simple back-end server utilizing Express. Styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS and the icon library of Font Awesome. Data for this website is stored in the Angular TypeScript files.

## Future Development

Future releases of this website will include a blog section.
